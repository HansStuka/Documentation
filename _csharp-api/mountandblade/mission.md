# Mission

You can think of Missions as GameModes\(Battles/TeamDeathMatch\) etc. Missions are instantiated with a [Scene](../engine/scene.md), [MissionViews](missionbehaviour/missionview.md), and [MissionBehaviours](missionbehaviour/README.md).

More information on missions will be available once we gain access to the `CampaignSystem` DLLs.

## Tips

* You can get the current mission instance \(if any\) by using `Mission.Current` property.
